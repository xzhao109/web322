            Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted,
            farmed, and scavenged animals for meat since prehistoric times.

                Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other
                kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an
                increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease,
                especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact,
                being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest
                greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

                Lamb, hogget, and mutton, generically sheep meat,are the meat of
                domestic sheep, Ovis aries. A sheep in its first year is a lamb
                and its meat is also lamb.

                Pork, its myoglobin content is lower than that of beef, but much
                higher than that of chicken, so the USDA treats pork as a red
                meat.[22] In 1987 the U.S. National Pork Board began an
                advertising campaign to position pork as "the other white
                meat"â€”due to a public perception of chicken and turkey (white
                meat) as healthier than red meat. The campaign was highly
                successful and resulted in 87% of consumers identifying pork
                with the slogan. The board retired the slogan on 4 March 2011.

            Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of
            mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals
            (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest
            solid food

            Eggs are laid by female animals of many different species, including
            birds, reptiles, amphibians, a few mammals, and fish, and many of
            these have been eaten by humans for thousands of years.Eggs are laid
